# Coin system

Every time the User do a workout there's a coin for that, let's trust the Mate about the workout, just remember that this is not a competition.

The coin system will work this way, for each workout the User earn +1 coin, in each 10 days streak count, the daily workout increase +1 coin, so for eg. in the 30ยบ day the user register the daily workout he will get +4 coins (1(base coin) + 3(30 days streak), the daily streak can be lost by failing a count of days defined on crew rules, we suggest two days at least from the last workout, to let Users rest.

Let's talk about the streaks, the streaks are classified as weekends, weekly, monthly, yearly:
- for every paid weekend day (saturday or sunday), the User will get a bounty of +1 coin;
- for each week, the User will get a bounty of +2 coins;
- for each month, the User will get a bounty of +10 coins;
- for each yearly, the User will get a bounty of 300 coins (Lot of coins huh).

The bounties are unique, and validated for all crew streaks, so if the User is in a crew that's just daily, weekly and another that's weekly and monthly, the User will get the daily, weekly and monthly bounty one single time, every time It earn a bounty, also the user will have a receipt for every earned coin. The bounty count resets every time the User receive.

### ATTENTION

All the workout have the same value, if the User do more than one workout by day, It does not have the same effect for coin system, the User will only get one bounty per day, It will work the same if User join multiple crews, even if the User share one workout to one crew and then another in another crew, only the first workout will count to the system, the share feature are only to mention the workout in the crews activities.

The streak bounty works as the same from daily bounty, so if the user joins a crew, the bounty does not increase for more crews joined, the crew streaks are only a way to have more fun with mates.

Don't fight at all with your mates about earning more coins, just add more streaks count to your crew. :)

### Lose Streak

To lose a streak, the user needs to fail for the days defined on the crews rule "Lose streak at fail for", if the user is in multiple crews, the lose streak days are defined by the minimum value. So if there's a crew with 5 fail days and another with 2 fail days, if the user pass 2 days without do any workout, the user loses the streak. 

To recover the streak, the user needs to be in one crew with the rule "allow PAID on past 2 days", this will allow the user add an workout on past day, eg. the day he loses the
