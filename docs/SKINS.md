# Skins & Character creation

The idea is use SVG files with custom colors to make it easier to work with. The skins and char base will be created at the same size and configuration (like 64px grid)

The generated files should be have an preview (e.g. hair preview will be with head) and a base icon to use on character creation. 
A pallete will be created and used to keep the same colors for clothes, and there's a base color for skin and clothes, to replace in svg. 

The process to create an item is:

>  Design in aseprite tool ->  Validate with base character -> Convert to SVG on [Pixels to svg](https://cdpn.io/shshaw/debug/XbxvNj)   -> Upload in cloudinary folders -> Add item to Item migration -> Run item migration to create single item or items -> Validate in App.

For beta testing, there will be two genders male and female, and few base items to let user pick, and in the shop users can buy more skins to use.

As the user progress on missions and achievements, it will be able to purchase more skins.
