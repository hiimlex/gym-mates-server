# Missions

Missions are a way to encourage users to complete specific tasks or challenges within the app. They can be designed to promote engagement, foster community interaction, and enhance the overall user experience.

The missions are related to the achievements system, so when the user complete a mission, it will unlock an achievement and get a reward in coins.

### Achievements

The achievements system is designed to recognize and reward users for their accomplishments within the app. When a user completes a mission, they will unlock a corresponding achievement, which will grant them a mission reward and unlocks new items in the store.

Some items have requirements to be unlocked, those requirements are related to the achievements system, each requirement has rarity levels, the higher the rarity, the harder it is to unlock the item.

Not all missions and achievements will be visible to the user, some of them will be hidden until the user complete them, this is to encourage exploration and discovery within the app.

When a user completes a mission and unlocks an achievement, they will receive new missions, new items in the store, and new challenges to keep them engaged and motivated.
